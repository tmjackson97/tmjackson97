Hi, I’m Taylor 👋
About Me

Cybersecurity student currently taking CSC-113: AI Fundamentals, learning how to collaborate effectively with AI tools rather than just use them. I’m especially interested in how AI fits into security analysis, automation, and decision-making.

My Foo 🎯

Cybersecurity + critical thinking through systems — I like breaking complex systems apart (networks, software, social systems, narratives) to understand how they actually work, where they fail, and how they’re manipulated.

Projects & Things I’m Building 🛠️

🧠 K–12 Test Practice Desktop App (Python / PyQt5)
A full-featured offline/online test-taking application for school computers.

Modular screen design (Home, Test Selection, Test Taking, Results)

Test downloads via GitHub API

Interactive tools: highlighter, underline, strike-through, eraser

Local scoring and grading logic

Designed for constrained school environments

🔐 Cybersecurity Labs & Analysis (Hack The Box)
Hands-on SOC-style investigation and exploitation labs.

Completed machines like Jerry and Responder

Sherlocks focused on incident response, log analysis, and attacker behavior

Experience with Elastic Stack, Splunk, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping

🏭 ICS / OT Exposure Research
Research and reporting on exposed industrial systems.

Identifying publicly reachable infrastructure

Vendor and vulnerability correlation

Communicating findings responsibly in a professional context
